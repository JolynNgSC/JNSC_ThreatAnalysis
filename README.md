# Threat Analysis
The following research was conducted in 2023, focusing on Threat Analysis and its processes. The aim was to comprehend the fundamental concepts of this specific cybersecurity management process.

## Process of Understanding 
Threat analysis is a cybersecurity strategy that aims to assess an organizationâ€™s security protocols, processes & procedures to identify threats & vulnerabilities (What Is Threat Analysis? | VMware, 2022).

Three main things we focus on are **'Vulnerability'**, **'Threats'**, **'Assests'**. Together it forms different risks.
